# ChromatinImaging

Repository for data, scripts and functions used in our super-resolution chromatin tracing (2018) project:
(Super-resolution chromatin tracing reveals domains and cooperative interactions in single cells)[http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6413/eaau1783]

The repository contains data and functions for STORM and Optical Reconstruction of Chromatin Architecture (ORCA) approach. The former method uses STORM to compute a 3D structure of each 30 kb segment in the labelled ~2000 kb domain.  The latter method just measures the centroid position of each 30 kb segment along the domain. Both approaches are capable of resolving adjacent 30 kb regions separated by much less than the diffraction limit of light. 

The ORCA approach has both MATLAB and python 2.7 code, written by Bogdan Bintu.

The data for this project are in the Data subfolder of this repository.
